        <p>
          I am a passionate and driven Software Developer based in Manchester. I
          recently graduated from the Northcoders bootcamp and have also
          graduated from the University of Manchester a few years previously in
          Economics. I have previous experience in fast paced management and
          sales roles working to meet KPI’s, creating and managing my own
          workload and with various teams. I have a strong emotional and
          academic intelligence that make me a quick learner and strong team
          worker.

        <h2>Welcome to my site</h2>
        <h5>
          This responsive site was made with HTML and CSS.
        </h5>
        <p>
          I have links above to my apps, as well as their repos. I will be
          regularly adding to them while I spend my corona isolation learning
          new tech and developing new apps.
          <br />
          Below I have listed some further info on my projects.

        <h2>MonitAir</h2>
        <img src="monitAir.png" alt="monitAir" class="monitAir" />
        <p>
          MonitAir is a smart app designed to regulate air quality in your home.
          Using a sensor on a Raspberry Pi, Air Quality, Temperature and
          Humidity are all monitored and reported. This could then react and
          help alter conditions if air quality became poor. The app was made in
          React Native, the back end was written in Python, uses PSQL and
          interacts with the Raspberry Pi. The front end was written in
          Typescript and uses a Firebase authentication system.
        </p>
        <h2>Forum - NC News</h2>
        <p>
          NC News is a Reddit esque forum created on React. Written in
          Javascript it is a React App, with a back end hosted on Heroku. The
          app uses a RESTful API and has a dummy login system. The front end is
          syled with CSS and the app is hosted on Netlify. The app was made with
          TDD using Mocha and Chai.
        </p>
        <h2>Task app</h2>
        <p>
          This is a to-do app built using the new React feature of Context and
          Hooks. I have also used Reducers on it as I wanted to learn and
          practice with what I think is going to be a major developer tool over
          the next few years. The app uses local storage to store tasks and is
          hosted on Netlify.
