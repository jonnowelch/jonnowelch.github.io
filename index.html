        <p>
          I am a passionate and driven Software Developer based in Manchester. I
          recently graduated from the Northcoders bootcamp and have also
          graduated from the University of Manchester a few years previously in
          Economics. I have previous experience in fast paced management and
          sales roles working to meet KPI’s, creating and managing my own
          workload and with various teams. I have a strong emotional and
          academic intelligence that make me a quick learner and strong team
          worker.

        <h2>Thanks for visiting my site</h2>

        <p>
          I have links above to my apps, as well as their repos. I will be
          regularly adding to them while I spend my corona isolation learning
          new tech and developing new apps.
          <br />
          Below I have listed some further info on some of my projects.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>MonitAir</h2>
        <h5>React Native app for Android and iOS</h5>
        <img src="monitAir.png" alt="monitAir" class="monitAir" />

        <p>
          MonitAir is a smart app designed to regulate air quality in your home.
          Using a sensor on a Raspberry Pi, Air Quality, Temperature and
          Humidity are all monitored and reported. This could then react and
          help alter conditions if air quality became poor. The app was made in
          React Native, the back end was written in Python, uses PSQL and
          interacts with the Raspberry Pi. The front end was written in
          Typescript and uses a Firebase authentication system.
        </p>
        <h2>WeatherNow!</h2>
        <h5>React Native app for Android and iOS</h5>
        <p>
          WeatherNow! is a react native front end app that tells you weather
          conditions in any world city currently. It calls on the
          https://openweathermap.org/api API for data and allows you to impact
          and re render the data that is displayed on the screen. The app uses
          full TDD for utility functions with Mocha and Chai, Formik forms for
          easy data handling and validation of search queries and RN Picker
          Select to create a custom dropdown country menu to remove client side
          error.
        </p>
        <h2>Forum - NC News</h2>
        <h5>React JS app</h5>
        <p>
          NC News is a Reddit esque forum created on React. Written in
          Javascript it is a React App, with a back end hosted on Heroku. The
          app uses a RESTful API and has a dummy login system. The front end is
          syled with CSS and the app is hosted on Netlify. The app was made with
          TDD using Mocha and Chai.
        </p>
        <h2>Film Review App</h2>
        <h5>React Native app for Android and iOS</h5>
        <p>
          This film review app allows you add personal reviews and ratings for
          films you have seen. The app uses routing between pages as well as
          drawer navigation. I created some custom UI for buttons and cards for
          a better user experience. I also used modals and Formik forms for
          validation of input.
        </p>
        <h2>Task app</h2>
        <h5>React Native app for Android and iOS</h5>

        <p>
          This is a to-do app built using the new React feature of Context and
          Hooks. I have also used Reducers on it as I wanted to learn and
          practice with what I think is going to be a major developer tool over
          the next few years. The app uses local storage to store tasks and is
          hosted on Netlify.
        </p>
        <h2>Current project</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently working on a front end app using
          https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php API. I am using React Native to
          build it and hope to have an MVP ready within the next few weeks.
